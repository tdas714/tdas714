- 🌱 I’m currently Working on developing an AI based Blockchain to make blockchain technology more accessible to non-technical individual around the world. 
      My main focus is to make a network, 
      1. that provides equal opportunity to every nodes(no specilaized hardware), 
      2. that has same scalability as traditional system.
      3. that is very fast and relable like traditional sysytem.
